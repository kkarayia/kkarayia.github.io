      <h3 class="accent">Researcher ~ Advocate ~ Teacher</h3>
      <h6>PhD Student, <a href="https://ps.soceco.uci.edu" target="_blank">Department of Psychological Science, UC Irvine</a></h6>
      <p>I am a PhD student at the University of California, Irvine specializing in Developmental Psychology and Quantitative Methodology. My research interests include understanding why certain groups of children learn differently 
        and how to improve learning and later-life outcomes for underserved populations via policy change. I currently work with Dr. Mark Warschauer and other brilliant scientists at the UCI Digital Learning Lab</p>
    <br>
    <p> My upcoming dissertation will focus on examining associations between children's attention and their learning from dialogic television programming.</p>
     <br>
    <p>My hobbies include jigsaw puzzles, rollerskating, and relaxing at the beach with food and a good book.</p>
